# Project 0

This is my Project 0 for CS50's web development course. It is a website about life in lockdown, built during the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020.

The documents in this project are:
* index.html welcomes users to the site
* about.html is about me and what I have been doing during lockdown
* shopping-times.html which contains information about my local supermarket shopping times
* activity-ideas.html which contains links to ideas for activities to do during lockdown
* images folder contains jpeg images used in activity-ideas.html
* svg folder contains an svg used as a list icon in shopping-times.html
